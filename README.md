[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pedrorijo91/play-slick3-steps.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/pedrorijo91/play-slick3-steps)

Simple working app using play 2.4 and slick 3.1.0 with mysql. Step by step tutorial at [https://pedrorijo91.github.io/blog/play-slick/](https://pedrorijo91.github.io/blog/play-slick/)

Created since the [available demos](https://github.com/playframework/play-slick/tree/master/samples) have too much irrelevant code to who wants to integrate slick 3.1.0 with a play app.

Based on [bhavyalatha26/play-scala-slick-example](https://github.com/bhavyalatha26/play-scala-slick-example).

Removed some code such as:

* Dependency Injection with [guice](https://github.com/google/guice)
* Traits and implementation classes
* Useless controllers
* Support for i18n
* activator
